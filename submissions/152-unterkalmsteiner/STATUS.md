# Badge motivation
With this submission, we apply for the "Reusable" badge because we provide:

1. The source code of the presented recommender. The code can be reused and extended by fellow researchers or practitioners.
2. The instrumentation used during the experiment. The environment provides the data as it was collected during the experiment. In principle, someone could take this artifact and replicate the experiment.
3. The data collected during the experiment and from the two domain experts who assessed the accuracy of the produced mappings. This allows other researcher to replicate the analysis.
4. The R scripts for the statistical analysis, enabling traceability from data collection to the conclusions made in the paper.
