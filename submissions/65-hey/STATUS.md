We are applying for the **Artifacts Available** badge, as our dataset, results and scripts used to calculate these results are publicly available under [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3833660](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3833660).

Additionally, we are applying for the **Artifacts Reusable** badge, as we provide all material needed to reproduce our results and documented the steps to run the experiments in the README and INSTALL files as well as in the scripts themselves.
We also provide scripts to apply provided pretrained models to any given requirement and thus facilitate reuse and repurposing of our artifacts.
