# Artifact Description
## 35 - The Lack of Shared Understanding of Non-Functional Requirements in ContinuousS oftware Engineering: Accidental or Essential?

As part of our study we performed qualitative analysis of 41 NFR-related rework study through the use of focus-groups at three independent organizations to study the relationship between NFRs and shared understanding in continuous software engineering. We used open-coding to perform thematic synthesis to analyze the transcripts of our focus-groups. These artifacts represent the data for our thematic synthesis.

Our replication package contains two artifacts:
1. Codebook.csv: Contains each of our codes, a description of the code, at what point during coding that code was introduced, the total number of tasks that code appeared in, the number of tasks that code appeared in for each organization (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), the total number of occurrences across all tasks, the number of occurrences across across each organization (Alpha, Beta, and Gamma), and the number of occurrences for each task.
2. kappa-values.csv: Contains the interview rounds and the associated kappa values calculated for our inter-rater coding agreement.

While we recognize that the value and usefulness of our replication package is yet to-be-determined, in the interest of transparency of open science we published our artifacts. In light of this, we hope that these artifacts are useful to either replicate our findings or to further analyze to produce other enlightening results.
